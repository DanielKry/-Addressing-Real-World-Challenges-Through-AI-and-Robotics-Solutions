Automatic Sorting System Using AI and Robotics

This project addresses real-world challenges in manufacturing and logistics through an automated 
sorting system using the UR5e robotic arm and machine vision technology. The system identifies 
and sorts objects by color, demonstrating potential applications in recycling centers, warehouses, 
and e-commerce fulfillment centers. By simulating a manufacturing environment in Webots, the project 
showcases precise control and flexibility of the UR5e robot, integrated with advanced sensors and 
cameras. Despite challenges like potential misclassification under varying lighting conditions, 
the project illustrates the transformative potential of AI and robotics, highlighting both technical 
achievements and ethical considerations.
